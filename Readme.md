Hello evereyone.

I create this respository from the https://github.com/cuba-platform/saml-addon-demo to explain a case where you can see all parts working at finally. 
Don't get me wrong, https://github.com/cuba-platform/saml-addon-demo is great and I want to give thanks to glebshalyganov but I have to admit that 
I found a little dificult to make saml-addon-demo works and I want to help everyone and they can save their time.

Of course, is all free.
